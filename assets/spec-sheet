PROBLEM: Rock scissors paper is currently in text. IN order to make the game play more engaging, 
we need a user interface.  For nostaligic appeal. we will borrow heavily from the 80's arcade hit, Double Dragon. 

The user should be able to play the game by clicking on buttons. 

Game Play

DO print "Sept 24 2041, NYC....
        print "Willy and the dark warriros have once again captured Marian"
        print "This time, however, he's willing to fight you  man to man in a game of rock, scissors, paper...
        print "The stakes are high. Every second that goes by puts Marian's life at risk...
        print "Prepare to fight!"

                        print "play again?" 
                ELSE
